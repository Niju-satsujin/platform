Part 1 rebuild pack (w01) to reduce confusion.

What changed:
- Added Part Intro page (0/7) in parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/part.md
- Lesson pages are OVERVIEW only (concept + problem + example runs)
- Training pages contain the step-by-step GYM session
- Boss + Quiz included

How to apply:
- Copy `parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/` into your repo.
- Update your router to add a Training route for training/*.md pages.
- If your repo manifest format differs, use this pack's manifest.json as a mapping reference.

Give PROMPT_FOR_AGENT.txt to your agent to do the refactor automatically.
