You are my Course Rebuilder Agent.

Goal: Rebuild Part 1 (w01) so it is NOT confusing. Use a two-page model:
- Lesson Overview pages: explain concept + problem + how to use + practice preview (NO GYM here).
- Training pages: contain the GYM session (Warmup/Work/Prove/Ship) with step-by-step tasks.

INPUTS
Use the attached pack as the target structure:
- manifest.json
- parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/part.md
- parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/lessons/*.md
- parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/training/*.md
- parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/quest.md
- parts/w01-cli-logger-discipline/quiz.md

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1) Do NOT change file paths, filenames, IDs, or YAML front matter keys. Rewrite only bodies if needed.
2) No solution code. Only exact run/test commands and expected output patterns.
3) Keep English simple. Short sentences. No long theory blocks.
4) Every lesson and training page MUST include Future Lock: name the future week that depends on it and why.
5) Quizzes must be scenario/debugging-based (no definitions).

PART 1 “GAP FILLER” MANDATES
- Lesson 1 Boot: env var override TRUST_HOME + flags. Use 12-Factor Config: https://12factor.net/config
- Lesson 2 Router: token limit 1KB (reject >1024). Mention CWE-120: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html
- Lesson 3 Exit codes: handle SIGINT and exit 130. Link: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigaction.2.html and https://www.ibm.com/docs/sr/SSWRJV_10.1.0/lsf_admin/job_exit_codes_lsf.html
- Lesson 6 Harness: list EXACT 12 regression tests (help/version/unknown/missing/env-vs-flag/oversize/logs/request_id/SIGINT=130).

LINKING RULE
Every technical concept mentioned must be a markdown link to high-quality docs:
- GNU CLI help/version: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Command_002dLine-Interfaces.html
- --help behavior: https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/_002d_002dhelp.html
- POSIX utility conventions: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html
- 12-Factor config/logs: https://12factor.net/config and https://12factor.net/logs
- Signals: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html

Deliverable:
- Updated Part 1 files matching this structure, with clear navigation: Intro → Lesson Overview → Training → Boss → Quiz.
