# Week 23 — Documentation + Portfolio

## Big Picture

You have built an impressive system over 22 weeks. But if you cannot communicate what you built, hiring managers will never know. This week you create the documentation and portfolio materials that make CivicTrust a powerful job application asset.

Good documentation and a strong portfolio are often the difference between getting an interview and being ignored. A well-documented GitHub project with a clear README, architecture diagram, and demo script shows employers you can build real systems and communicate clearly.

## What you will build

- **Architecture diagram** — a visual overview of the entire system
- **Demo script** — a polished 5-minute demonstration
- **Story bank** — prepared answers for interview questions about CivicTrust
- **README polish** — a professional project README
- **Portfolio page** — a summary page for your personal website or GitHub profile

## Done when

Your project has professional documentation, a polished demo, prepared interview stories, and a portfolio-ready presentation. Repository tagged v0.23-portfolio.
