# Week 24 — Interview Prep + Final Demo

## Big Picture

This is the last week. You have spent 23 weeks building CivicTrust from scratch. Now you prepare to present it to the world — in job interviews, on your resume, and in conversations with other engineers.

This week focuses on three things: (1) technical interview preparation (distributed systems questions you should be able to answer), (2) debugging drills (timed exercises that simulate coding interviews), and (3) the final demo — a polished, rehearsed presentation of CivicTrust that showcases everything you have built.

After this week, you will have: a complete system, professional documentation, prepared interview stories, and the confidence to discuss distributed systems, cryptography, and production engineering in any job interview.

## What you will do

- **Distributed systems Q&A** — practice answering common interview questions
- **Debugging drills** — solve timed problems using skills from the program
- **Timed demo** — practice the 5-minute demo until it is flawless
- **Mock interview** — simulate a full technical interview
- **Final demo run** — the last run of the complete CivicTrust demo
- **Quality gate** — the final checklist

## Done when

You can confidently answer distributed systems questions, debug problems under time pressure, and present CivicTrust in a 5-minute demo. Final repo tagged v1.0-civictrust.
